# kmean_cluster_for_optimization

Acording to (Xu and Wunsch 2005), “Every day, people encounter a large amount of information and store or represent it as data, for further analysis and management. One of the vital means in dealing with these data is to classify or group them into a set of categories or clusters”. The objective of clustering is, then, to reduce the data, without losing its meaning considerably.

The clustering of the data must result in data that correspond to the initial system with a rigor less than or equal to the original data, and must also have a transfer function that defines the way in which the grouping of elements was carried out.

Several clustering algorithms were analyzed in the context of this work, where the main features that are useful in deciding which algorithm is interesting to use, is how to measure the proximity between elements, and how to choose the number of clusters.
